# Split a secret

Before you can split any secret, you have to configure a cyclic group to be used for Pedersen operations as is
shown in [Configure a cyclic group](group).

This example shows how to split a secret with a $(t, n)$-threshold scheme of $(t, n) = ($ `schemeThreshold` , `schemeParts` $)$.

```go showLineNumbers
import (
    "github.com/matteoarella/pedersen"
)

group := /* cyclic group */
schemeParts := 5
schemeThreshold := 3
// highlight-next-line
secret := /* secret to split */

p, err := pedersen.NewPedersen(schemeParts, schemeThreshold, pedersen.CyclicGroup(group))
if err != nil {
	panic(err)
}

// highlight-start
shares, err = p.Split(secret, nil)
if err != nil {
	panic(err)
}
// highlight-end

/* ...
   send shares parts to the corresponding shareholder and broadcast the commitments
   ...
*/
```

## Secret shares structure

When a secret is splitted with `pedersen.Split` a `pedersen.Shares` object is returned.
This object contains every information that the *dealer* has to transfer to the *shareholders*.

If the secret that has to be split is not representable in the cyclic group (this is the case
if the secret is bigger than the order of the cyclic group),
the secret is split into chunks, and each chunk is split into secret parts according
to Pedersen verifiable secret sharing.

### Abscissae vector

`Shares.Abscissae` is the abscissae vector used for computing the ordinate values of
the secret parts.
There is one abscissa for each *shareholder*, so if `shareholderIdx` represents
the index of one *shareholder*, `Abscissae[shareholderIdx]` is the abscissa
related to that *shareholder*.

### Secret parts

`Shares.Parts` is the matrix of secret parts.

The first index of `Shares.Parts` represents the shareholder index, while the second index
represents the chunk index (`Parts[shareholderIdx][chunkIdx]`).

### Secret commitments

`Shares.Commitments` is the matrix of commitments.
The first index of `Shares.Commitments` represents the chunk index so `Commitments[chunkIdx]`
is the vector of commitments related to the chunk with index `chunkIdx`.
