# Verify secret shares

With Pedersen verifiable secret sharing the sharing and the reconstruction of any secret can be verified.

- in the *sharing phase* each *Shareholder* can verify that the secret shares that he has
received are valid

- in the *reconstruction phase* the *Dealer* can verify that the secret shares received from the *shareholders*
are valid.

Before you can verify any secret shares, you have to configure a cyclic group to be used for Pedersen operations as is
shown in [Configure a cyclic group](group).

In the following examples a $(t, n)$-threshold scheme of $(t, n) = ($ `schemeThreshold` , `schemeParts` $)$ is assumed.

## Shareholder verification

When a *shareholder* privately receives a secret part and the corresponding broadcast secret commitments he can verify the part
in the following way.

```go
import (
    "github.com/matteoarella/pedersen"
)

schemeParts := 5
schemeThreshold := 3
group := /* cyclic group */
x := /* abscissa related to the shareholder part */
share := /* secret share received from the dealer */
commitments := /* commitments broadcast from the dealer */

p, err := pedersen.NewPedersen(schemeParts, schemeThreshold, pedersen.CyclicGroup(group))
if err != nil {
	panic(err)
}

err = p.Verify(x, share, commitments)
if err != nil {
	panic(err)
}
```

## Dealer verification

When a *dealer* receives a secret part from a *shareholder* he can verify the part
in the same way as shown in [Shareholder verification](verify#shareholder-verification).

```go
import (
    "github.com/matteoarella/pedersen"
)

schemeParts := 5
schemeThreshold := 3
group := /* cyclic group */
x := /* abscissa related to the shareholder part */
share := /* secret share received from the dealer */
commitments := /* commitments broadcast from the dealer */

p, err := pedersen.NewPedersen(schemeParts, schemeThreshold, pedersen.CyclicGroup(group))
if err != nil {
	panic(err)
}

err = p.Verify(x, share, commitments)
if err != nil {
	panic(err)
}
```

Additionally, the *dealer* can also collect every secret shares and then verify all of them in a
single step as is shown here:

```go
import (
    "github.com/matteoarella/pedersen"
)

schemeParts := 5
schemeThreshold := 3
group := /* cyclic group */
shares := /* secret shares assembled from every secret parts */

p, err := pedersen.NewPedersen(schemeParts, schemeThreshold, pedersen.CyclicGroup(group))
if err != nil {
	panic(err)
}

err = p.VerifyShares(shares)
if err != nil {
	panic(err)
}
```
